		<h2 id="1">Trees</h2>
		<p><strong>Trees</strong> are like linked lists in that nodes are connected together by pointers.  However, unlike linked lists, a tree can connect to multiple different nodes.  We will look at the following types of trees: binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced binary search trees.</p>
		
		<h3 id="1.1">Binary Trees</h3>
		<p>A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a tree that links to no more than two other <strong>nodes</strong>.  In the picture below, the top node is called the <strong>root</strong> node.  The nodes that connect to no other nodes are called <strong>leaf</strong> nodes.  Nodes are frequently also referred to <strong>parent</strong> and <strong>child</strong> nodes.  The nodes to the left of a parent node and the nodes to the right of a parent node each form a <strong>subtree</strong>.  There is always only one root node.  While not shown in the picture, it is common for child nodes to also point back up to the parent node (similar to a linked list).</p>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="binary_tree.jpeg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows a Binary Tree where the top (node A) is called the root, the nodes that do not conenct to any other nodes are called leaves (node D, E, and F).  Node A connects to nodes B and C.  Node B connects to node D and E.  Node C connects only to node F.  A subtree is formed from a any parent node such as node B and includes all of the children nodes D and E.">

            </figure>
		
		<h3 id="1.2">Binary Search Trees</h3>
		<p>A <strong>binary search tree</strong> (BST) is a binary tree that follows rules for data that is put into the tree.  Data is placed into the BST by comparing the data with the value in the parent node.  If the data being added is less than the parent node, then it is put in the left subtree.  If the data being added is greater (usually we will say greater than or equal to if duplicates are allowed) than the parent node, then it is put in the right subtree.  By using this process, the data is stored in the tree sorted.</p>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="binary_search_tree.jpeg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows a Binary Search Tree where the root node is 15.  The 15 is connected to 10 (on the left) and 24 (on the right).  The 10 is connected to 3 (on the left) and 14 (on the right).  The 24 is connected to 33 (on the right).">
            <figcaption>Binary Search Tree</figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>Using the tree above, we can determine where to put additional items.  We always start at the root node and compare the new value with it.  We keep comparing until we have found an empty place for the new node.  For example, to insert the value 20, do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><p>Start at the root node 15 and compare with the new value 20</p></li>
		<li><p>Since 20 is greater than 15, goto the right and visit node 24</p></li>
		<li><p>Since 20 is less than 24, goto the left and see there is no additional node</p></li>
		<li><p>Insert 20 in the empty spot to the left of 24.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="binary_search_tree_add_node.jpeg" height="100%" widgth="100%" alt="Shows the same binary search tree with node 20 added to the left of node 24.  Nodes 15, 24, and 20 are highlighted to show the path to find where the new node was inserted.">
		<figcaption>Add Node to BST</figcaption></figure>
            
		<p>The process that we used to find where to put the new node was an efficient process.  If we had a dynamic array or a linked list containing sorted values, we would have an O(n) operation as we search for the proper location to insert a value into the proper sorted position.  By using the BST, we are able to exclude a subtree with each comparison.  This ability to split the job in half recursively results in O(log n).  Maintaining sorted data in a BST performs better than other data structures.</p>
		
		<p>However, the only reason we had O(log n) in the example above was because the tree was "balanced".  To see the difference between a <strong>balanced</strong> and an unbalanced tree, we will construct a tree with the same values but in a different order.  The reason why the previous tree has 15 as the root node is because 15 was added first.  This time, we will add the values in the following order: 3, 10, 14, 15, 20, 24, 33 (purposefully in ascending order).</p>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="unbalanced_bst.jpeg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows a binary search tree with a root node of 3.  Each subsequent node is attached to the right including 10, 14, 15, 20, 24, and 33.">
		<figcaption>Unbalanced BST</figcaption></figure>
            
		<p>This tree is a BST but looks more like a linked list.  This BST is unbalanced has a resulting performance for searching of O(n) instead of O(log n).</p>
		
		<h3 id="1.3">Balanced Binary Search Trees</h3>
		<p>A <strong>balanced binary search tree</strong> (balanced BST) is a BST such that the difference of height between the two subtrees is not dramatically different.  The height of a tree can be found by counting the maximum number of nodes between the root and the leaves.  Since it is not reasonable to expect that the order of data will result in a balanced BST, numerous algorithms have been written to detect if a tree is unbalanced and to correct the unbalance.  Common algorithms include red black trees and AVL (Adelson, Velskii, and Landis) trees.  The example below shows an <strong>AVL tree</strong> which is balanced because the difference of height between subtrees is less than 2.</p>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="avl_tree_initial.jpeg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows an AVL tree where the root node is 15.  The 15 is connected to 10 (on the left) and 24 (on the right).  The 10 is connected to 3 (on the left) and 14 (on the right).   The 12 is connected to 14 (on the left).  The 24 is connected to 33 (on the right). Looking at the subtree starting with 10, the height to the 3 on the left is 2.  The height of the subtree to the 12 on the right is 3.">
		<figcaption>Balanced AVL Tree</figcaption></figure>
        
		<p>If we add 13 to the right of the 12, we end up with an unbalanced AVL tree because the height of the right subtree from 10 is now 2 more than the left subtree.</p>
		
        <figure>
		<img src="avl_tree_unbalanced.jpeg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows the same AVL tree but with node 13 added to the right of 12.  The height between node 10 and node 13 is now 4.">
            <figcaption>Unbalanced AVL Tree after Adding Node</figcaption></figure>
            
		<p>The AVL algorithm will detect that the tree has become unbalanced.  To balance the tree, a node rotation will be performed.  For our tree, we can rotate the node with 13 so that nodes 12 and 14 are children nodes of the 13.  When this rotation is done, the tree returns to a balanced state.  An AVL tree will always be a Balanced BST and therefore benefit from O(log n) performance.</p>

        </figure>    
		
		<h2 style="counter-reset: h3">BST Operations</h2>
		
		<p>BST operations can be very complicated (balanced BST's offering even more complication).  We will look at two operations in our study of trees:  inserting and traversing.</p>
		
		<h3 id="1.4">Inserting into a BST</h3>
		
		<p>Inserting into a BST is a recursive operations:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Smaller problem: Insert a value into either the left subtree or the right subtree based on the value.</p></li>
		<li><p>Base case: If there is space to add the node (the subtree is empty), then the correct place has been found and the item can be inserted.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The code for inserting into a BST is shown below.  Some things to note are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>A node is defined as an object (in this example) of class <code>BST.Node</code>.  This is similar to what we saw with the linked list class.  The <code>Node</code> class is called an inner class because it's defined inside the <code>BST</code> class.  The Node class contains three things: <code>data</code> (the value), <code>left</code> (pointer to the left node), and <code>right</code> (pointer to the right node).</p></li>
		<li><p>There are two functions.  The <code>insert</code> function is the one called by the user who wants to insert a value into the tree.  This function is used to call the recursive function <code>_insert</code> starting at the root node.  As a special case, if the root node is empty (<code>none</code>), then we will put the new node in the root without using any recursion.  We will follow this pattern for many of the recursive functions we write for the BST.</p></li>
		<li><p>In the <code>_insert</code> function, we should identify the base case and the recursive calls to the correct subtrees.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<pre><code class="Python">		
def insert(self, data):
	"""
	Insert 'data' into the BST.  If the BST
	is empty, then set the root equal to the new 
	node.  Otherwise, use _insert to recursively
	find the location to insert.
	"""
	if self.root is None:
		self.root = BST.Node(data)
	else:
		self._insert(data, self.root)  # Start at the root

def _insert(self, data, node):
	"""
	This function will look for a place to insert a node
	with 'data' inside of it.  The current subtree is
	represented by 'node'.  This function is intended to be
	called the first time by the insert function.
	"""
	if data &lt; node.data:
		# The data belongs on the left side.
		if node.left is None:
			# We found an empty spot
			node.left = BST.Node(data)
		else:
			# Need to keep looking.  Call _insert
			# recursively on the left subtree.
			self._insert(data, node.left)
	elif data &gt;= node.data:
		# The data belongs on the right side.
		if node.right is None:
			# We found an empty spot
			node.right = BST.Node(data)
		else:
			# Need to keep looking.  Call _insert
			# recursively on the right subtree.
			self._insert(data, node.right)

		</code></pre>	
		<h3 id="1.5">Traversing a BST</h3>
		
		<p>We <strong>traverse</strong> a BST when we want to display all the data in the tree.  An in-order traversal will visit each node from smallest to largest.  A similair process can be followed to visit each node from the largest to the smallest.  This is also a recursive process:</p>

		<ul>
		<li><p>Smaller problem: Traverse the left subtree of a node, use the current node, and then traverse the right subtree of the node.</p></li>
		<li><p>Base case: If the subtree is empty, then don't recursively traverse or use anything.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The code for traversing a BST is shown below.  In addition to the observations made to the insert code above, we should note the following additional things about this algorithm:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><p>The starting function is called <code>__iter__</code>.  The use of double underscores in Python means that this function is part of the Python framework.  When we write code like <code>for item in collection</code>, the <code>__iter__</code> function is called on the <code>collection</code> to get the next item.  In our case, the <code>__iter__</code> will provide the user the next value in the BST.</p></li>
		<li><p>The <code>yield</code> command is used to provide the next value to the <code>for</code> loop.  The <code>yield</code> is like a <code>return</code> statement in a function.  However, unlike a <code>return</code>, the <code>yield</code> will allow the function to start back where it left off in the function when <code>__iter__</code> is called again.  If we want to provide the value that is returned from a function, the command is modified to be <code>yield from</code>.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<pre><code class="Python">		
def __iter__(self):
	"""
	Perform a forward traversal (in order traversal) starting from 
	the root of the BST.  This function is called when a loop
	is performed:

	for value in my_bst:
		print(value)

	"""
	yield from self._traverse_forward(self.root)  # Start at the root

def _traverse_forward(self, node):
	"""
	Does a forward traversal (in-order traversal) through the 
	BST.  If the node that we are given (which is the current
	subtree) exists, then we will keep traversing on the left
	side (thus getting the smaller numbers first), then we will 
	provide the data in the current node, and finally we will 
	traverse on the right side (thus getting the larger numbers last).

	The use of the 'yield' will allow this function to support loops
	like:

	for value in my_bst:
		print(value)

	The keyword 'yield' will return the value for the 'for' loop to
	use.  When the 'for' loop wants to get the next value, the code in
	this function will start back up where the last 'yield' returned a 
	value.  The keyword 'yield from' is used when we want to 'yield' a
	value that is returned from a function.

	This function is intended to be called the first time by 
	the __iter__ function.
	"""
	if node is not None:
		yield from self._traverse_forward(node.left)
		yield node.data
		yield from self._traverse_forward(node.right)
		
		</code></pre>	
		
		<p>A reverse traversal is frequently associated with the <code>__reversed__</code> function in Python.</p>
		
		<h3 id="1.6">BST in Python</h3>
		
		<p>In your assignment this week you will be writing your own BST class.  Python does not have a built-in BST class.  However, there are packages that can be installed from other developers such as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bintrees/" target="_blank">bintrees</a> that provides implementations of the BST.The table below shows the common functions in a BST.</p>
