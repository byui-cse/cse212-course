		<h2 id="1">About CSE 212</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to CSE 212 - Programming with Data Structures.  This course is intended for students who have studied Python including functions and classes.  As you progress towards a career as a software engineer, this course will prepare you to effectively use data structures and increase your programming skills.  The successful CSE 212 student will develop the following skils:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Problem Solver: Apply a systematic approach to writing code to solve problems involving data structures.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Evaluator: Evaluate the performance of alternative solutions for code containing data structures using big O notation.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Reviewer: Predict the purpose and behavior of existing code containing data structures. </p></li>
        <li><p>Tester: Discover defects using testing in code containing data structures. </p></li>
        <li><p>Conversant: Articulate the answers to technical questions involving data structures.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Self-Reliant: Solve problems using data structures independently. </p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Data structures are containers that hold information.  There are different data structures which are suited for different purposes.  In this course, you will study the following data structures:  dynamic array, stack, queue, set, map, linked list, and tree.  You will also learn about big O performane and recursion.  </p>

        <p>The course is divided into three phases:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Phase 1 - Prepare (Lessons 1-5)</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You will learn programming skills and techniques and apply them to data structures.</p></li>
            <li><p>You will complete pratice problems with your study group and discuss the solutions together.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your individual assignments will be simalar to the prative problems.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>Phase 2 - Teach (Lessons 6-9)</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You will learn complex data structures and rely on your skills disovered in the Prepare phase.</p></li>
            <li><p>You will have a set of problems to individually solve each week.</p></li>
            <li><p>You will meet with your study group to collaborate on these problems (without sharing solutions).</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>Phase 3 - Prove (Lessons 10-14)</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You will demonstrate what you learned in the Prepare and Teach phases by completing a final individual project.</p></li>
            <li><p>Class time will be given to work on your final project.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>This course is designed to provide opportunties for you to learn with your peers while at the same time demonstrating your personal mastery of the material.  You should only collaborate with other students as directed in the assignments.  When working with TA's, tutors, and other individuals outside of class, you should not seek or receive direct help in answering a problem that you were expected to answer on your own.  You should reach out to learn course material and then demonstrate your understanding on your own.</p>
        
        <p>Many programming problems in this course have solutions that with some effort could be found online.  For this purpose, many of the assignments will require written responses in addition to Python code.  When you interview with potential employers, you will not have the luxury of a web search engine to help you answer the question.  You will need to be prepared to articulate your answers clearly to others.  The successful CSE 212 student will gain this skill.</p>
        
        <h2 id="2">Course Reading</h2>
        
        <p>Each lesson will have reading in I-Learn.  During the Prepare phase of the course, the reading will include material for a new data structure and new programming skill.  During the Teach phase of the course, only a new data structure will be presented.  No new material will be presented during the Prove phase except for the details of the final project.</p>
        
        <p>Each of the readings will include an overview of the topic including several examples.  The application of the topic to Python and the performance implications will also be discussed.  Key terms will be highlighted when first used in each of the reading.  Definitions for these key terms is summarized in the last section of each reading.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to the reading provided, there is plenty of documentation on the internet and in libraries, including the BYU-Idaho online databases.  You may want to visit the <a href="http://go.oreilly.com/byu-idaho">Safari Books Online</a> database supported by the BYU-Idaho library and search for various books on the subject of data structures.</p>        
        
        <h2 id="3">Development Environment</h2>
        
        <p>The development environment for this course is simalar to previous Python courses.  Your development environment must be functional to sucessfully submit assignments during the first lesson.</p>

		<h3 id="3.1">Python</h3>
        
        <p>You need Python 3.x installed on your computer.  If you already have it installed from a previous class, then you will not need to take any additional action.  If you don't have Python installed, you should visit the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Downloads</a> website and follow the instructions to install the latest 3.x version.</p>
        
        <h3 id="3.2">Visual Studio Code</h3>
        
        <p>The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for BYU-Idaho programming classes is Visual Studio Code.  If you already have this tool installed from a previous class, then you wil lnot need to take any additional ation.  If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, you should the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code Download</a> website and follow the instructions.  After installation, you should install the Python Extension for Visual Studio Code.  Visual Studio Code should prompt you to install this after you create your first Python (.py) file.</p>
        
        <p>The following websites may be useful for installing these tools:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">Visual Studio Code Tutorial</a></p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6">Visual Studio Code Videos</a> (the first four videos provide a good introduction</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="3.3">Virtual Environments and Pip</h3>
        
        <p>While not required, it is recommended that you begin using virtual environments with Python.  A virtual environment creates a private copy of Python for your projects.  If you install a Python library using <code>pip</code>, the library will be installed in the virtual environment only.  To create a virtual environment, do the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Create a new folder for your project or course work.</p></li>
        <li><p>Open the folder within Visual Studio Code</p></li>
        <li><p>Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code and type the following:</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Windows: <code>py -m venv venv</code></p></li>
            <li><p>Mac\Linux: <code>python3 -m venv venv</code></p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>The previous command will create a new sub-folder containing your virtual environment called <code>venv</code> in your code folder.  Visual Studio Code should prompt you to start using this new virtual environment.  If this does not happen, manually select the version of Python by clicking on the Python interpreter version on the status bar at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.  You may need to create a Python (.py) file first for Visual Studio Code to allow this.  When seleting the Python interperter, make sure you select the virtual environment.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For more help in setting up a virtual environment, visit the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments">Visual Studio Code Environment</a> website.</p>
        
        <p>If you are using a virtual environment, you can use the following commands to list, install, or remove a Python library as needed:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p><code>pip list</code> - Display all Python libraries in the virtual environment</p></li>
        <li><p><code>pip install library-name</code> - Install a Python library into the virtual environment</p></li>
        <li><p><code>pip uninstall libary-name </code> - Remove a Python library from the virtual environment</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you are not using a virtual environment, you will still need to ensure that the correct Python is being used by Visual Studio Code.  It is possible to install many different versions including distributions like Anaconda.  On a Mac computer, you will also find a version of Python 2.x installed.  The instructions above for selecting the right Python interpreter for Visual Studio Code should be used.  To run pip without a virtual environment, you will need to modify your commands:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Windows: <code>py -m pip install library-name</code></p></li>
        <li><p>Mac\Linux: <code>pip3 install library-name</code></p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="4">Downloading Course Files</h2>
        
        <p>In the Teach activities and Prove assignments, you will frequently be asked to download documents and files.  Depending on the browser you are using, the file may cause additional tabs to open.  If a file is displayed in a tab instead of downloading, then you may need to right click on the link to download the file.  When downloading Python files (with a .py extension) your browser may give you a warning about a potential dangerous files.  If you were not a programmer, you would not want to download Python files since you may be receiving one from an untrusted person.  However, since you are a programmer and are taking a programming class, you should trust these files for download.</p>
        
        <p>Every file that you download contains the following warning:  "It is a violation of BYU-Idaho Honor Code to post or share this code with others or to post it online.  Storage into a personal and private repository (e.g. private GitHub repository, unshared Google Drive folder) is acceptable." It is very important that you follow these rules for all material in the course.</p>
        
        <p>The Prove assignments will include a Response Document that you must use to provide your responses to questions.  When you submit your assignment, you will need to submit the completed Response Document along with any required python code files.</p>
