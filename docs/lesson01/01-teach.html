      <h1>01 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>You should complete these practice problems with one or more members from your assigned study group.  <strong>Your study group has already been assigned to you in I-Learn.</strong>  You will be solving problems with Python by following the different problem solving strategies (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 1).  This practice is simlair to the individual work you will complete in <a href="01-prove.html" target="_blank">01-Prove</a>. This practice should take no more than 1 hour.  If you are about to run out of time, you may look at the solutions and discuss them.</p>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  <h3>Problem 1 - List Comprehension</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>To ensure you have enough time for this activity, spend no more than 15 minutes implementing this function before looking at the solution to discuss.</p></li>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="divisors.py" target="_blank">divisors.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>find_divisors_1</code> function.  The function should create and return a list of divisors of the number provided into the function.  The list should include the value 1 but should not include the actual number.  If the number was 12, then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].  If the number was 17, then the resulting list would be just [1] because 17 is prime.  When implementing the first function, use a for loop, an if statement, and call append.</p></li>
			<li><p>Reimplement the function using only a list comprehension in <code>find_divisors_2</code></p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your answer with the following solution and discuss together: <a href="divisors-solution.py" target="_blank">divisors-solution.py</a></p></li>
		</ol>
	  <h3>Problem 2 - Solving a Complicated Problem</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="list_selector.py" target="_blank">list_selector.py</a></p></li>		
			<li><p>Come up with a plan (up to 10 minutes) on how to implement the <code>list_selector</code> function.  The function takes two lists and a selector list.  The 2 lists are combined together into a new list according to the selector list.  The selector list only contains 1's and 2's.  A value of 1 means that you should select the next number from the first list.  A value of 2 means that you should select the next number from the second list.  For example, if list 1 is [1, 2, 3, 4] and iflist 2 is [10, 20, 30, 40] and if the selector list is [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2] then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 10, 20, 3, 4, 30, 40].</p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your plan with the following plan and discuss together: <a href="list_selector-approach.html" target="=_blank">list_selector-approach.html</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>list_selector</code> function.</p></li>
			<li><p>Compare your answer with the following solution and discuss together: <a href="list_selector-solution.py">list_selector-solution.py</a></p></li>
		</ol>
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>When finished, please complete the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
