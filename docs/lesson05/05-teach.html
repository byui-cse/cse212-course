      <h1>W05 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
	  <h2>Instructions</h2>
		
	  <p>These problems should be completed and discussed as a group.  Answers are provided below.</p>
		
	  <h3>Problem 1 - Unique Letters</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
		  <p> Download the following code and load it into your code editor: <a href="05-teach_unique_letters.py" target="_blank">05-teach_unique_letters.py</a></p></li>
		<li><p>This code will determine if a string has all unique letters. For example, "abcdefg" has unique letters but "abccdefg" does not because the "c" is repeated more than once.  The code is implemented using loops which results in an O(n^2) performance.</p></li>
		<li><p>Answer this question together:  how can the unique letter function be written with O(n) performance using a set?  As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of a set to help you arrive at the answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you think you know how to solve the problem (take no more than five minutes), <a href="05-teach_unique_letters-solution.html" target="_blank">read the answer to the question</a> and compare with your initial answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>Based on your understanding, modify the <code>unique_letters</code> function so achieves O(n) using a set.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="05-teach_unique_letters-solution.py" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.</p></li>
			</ol>
	  <h3>Problem 2 - Display Sums</h3>	
  	  <ol>
		  <li><p>Download the following code and load it into your code editor: <a href="05-teach_display_sums.py" target="_blank">05-teach_display_sums.py</a></p></li>
		  <li>
			<p>Your goal is to write a program that will find and display all pairs of numbers in a list that sum up to 10.  No duplicates should be displayed.  This could be done in O(n^2) with a loop within a loop.  However, using a set, this can be done in O(n) time.  You should assume that the list of numbers provided has no duplicates.
			</p>
		  </li>
		<li><p>Answer this question together:  how can you solve this problem using a set data structure?  As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of a set to help you arrive at the answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you think you know how to solve the problem (take no more than five minutes), <a href="05-teach_display_sums-solution.html" target="_blank">read the answer to the question</a> and compare with your initial answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>Based on your understanding, implement the <code>display_sums</code> function.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="05-teach_display_sums-solution.py" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.</p></li>
